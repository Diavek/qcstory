,fetchNarration,40,40,50,Encryption is difficult to do on an IoT device. The encryption on a smartphone takes 3MB to encrypt a signal message and then decrypt on the back-end. It takes 14 rounds of encryption to get that done.,"If you have a small IoT device (eg. A thermostat or temperature sensor), those devices have a maximum of 100kb (a class 0 device) in total operating capacity. It<q>'<q>s very unlikely that encryption can be done on a small IoT device.
